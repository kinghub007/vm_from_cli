# Shell Scripts to Create and Start, Stop or Login to a Running VM from CLI
These scripts create and start VM. The `create_vm.sh` script asks for user inputs and based on the inputs it creates the VM and `start_vm` asks for user inputs and based on the inputs it starts or stops a VM or help login to a running VM.
 
## Clone the repository
Clone the repository and use the `create_vm.sh` to create the VM and `start_vm.sh` to start or stop a VM or login to a running VM.
```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/kinghub007/vm_from_cli.git
cd vm_from_cli
sh create_vm.sh
```

# NB
* You might need to change some parameters in the `create_vm.sh` as the script is based on ubuntu ISOs.
